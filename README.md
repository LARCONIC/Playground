# 🎯Playground

**Playground** is an open-source community repo where developers  
build **small, eye-catching, single-file HTML projects** to show off their creativity.

No need for big full-stack apps –  
this place is all about **clean, creative, impressive frontend shots**. ⚡

## 🔫 What is a "shot"?

A **shot** is:

- a **single `.html` file**
- with **HTML + CSS + JS all inside that one file**
- focused on something **visual, interactive or surprising**  
  (buttons, loaders, cards, animations, effects, mini-toys, etc.)

Examples of shot filenames:

- `magic.html`
- `magic-light.html`
- `neon-button.html`
- `glass-card.html`

### Tech rules (for now):

- ✅ **Vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript**
- ✅ **CDN libraries allowed** (for example: fonts, icons, GSAP, etc.)
- ❌ **No frameworks** (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- ❌ **No separate `.css` or `.js` files** – everything stays in a single `.html` file

---

## 🎨 What kind of things can you build?

You can create:

- UI experiments
- micro-interactions
- fancy loaders
- CSS art
- animated cards, buttons, toggles
- tiny visual tools or toys

Basically anything that makes people say:

> “Wait… how did you do that? 👀”

## 🧩 Rules (for every shot)

1. Each shot must be a **single `.html` file**.
2. All **HTML, CSS and JS must live inside that file**:
   - CSS inside a `<style>` tag
   - JS inside a `<script>` tag
3. Name the file based on your shot / project idea:
   - `magic.html`
   - `magic-light.html`
   - `crazy-loader.html`
4. You **can** use CDNs for:
   - fonts (Google Fonts, etc.)
   - icon libraries
   - animation libraries (like GSAP)
   
   but **no JS frameworks** like React, Vue, etc.

## 🚀 How to add your shot

1. **Fork** this repo.
2. In the root of the repo, create a new `.html` file.  
   Example:
   - `magic.html`
   - `neon-button.html`
   - `glass-card.html`
3. Put your entire shot inside that one file.

Basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Magic Shot</title>
    <style>
      /* Write your CSS here */
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- Write your HTML here -->

    <script>
      // Write your JavaScript here
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
